# SDK Explorer

The Sanity App SDK Explorer contains an assortment of example interfaces built with our React SDK’s hooks.
The purpose of the Explorer is to demonstrate how these hooks can be used to build out interfaces powered
by Sanity, with a variety of approaches to styling.

Each example contains an interface rendered in the browser as well as a link to the example’s code on
GitHub to demonstrate how the example is built. Example code is enriched with comments and may freely
be used in your own applications.

## Running the SDK Explorer

We'll have a deployed version of the SDK Explorer available soon.

For now, you can run the SDK Explorer locally:

1. Clone the SDK Examples Git repo: `git clone git@github.com:sanity-io/sdk-examples.git`
1. Switch to the SDK Explorer app: `cd ./sdk-examples/sdk-explorer`
1. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
1. Run the application’s dev server: `pnpm dev`
1. Open the URL displayed by the dev server (usually `localhost:5173`)
