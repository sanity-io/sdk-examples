# SDK Explorer

üëâüèª **[https://sdk-explorer.sanity.io](https://sdk-explorer.sanity.io)**

The Sanity App SDK Explorer contains an assortment of example interfaces built with our React SDK‚Äôs hooks. The purpose of the Explorer is to demonstrate how these hooks can be used to build out interfaces powered by Sanity, with a variety of approaches to styling.

Each example contains an interface rendered in the browser as well as a link to the example‚Äôs code on GitHub to demonstrate how the example is built. Example code is enriched with comments and may freely be used in your own applications.
